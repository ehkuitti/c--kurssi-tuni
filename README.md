## [Programming 2: Structures](https://www.tuni.fi/fi/tule-opiskelemaan/fitech-ohjelmointi-2-rakenteet)

I participated in the Programming 2: Structures course offered by Tampere Open University in the fall of 2021. The course taught us how to use the C++ programming language. The original GitLab repo must be kept private for security reasons, which is why I copied its contents here.

### Course description

There were lectures once a week on the course, after which the weekly assignments were given. The course was structured as an on-campus implementation in Tampere. However, it was also possible to participate remotely via Zoom. In addition to this, weekly workshops were organized once a week in Tampere, where we went through tasks together under the guidance of the teacher. In addition to this, we had 4 projects, each of which had a couple of weeks of turnaround time.

### Course content

The course started right from the basics of C++ with handling of standard variables (`int', `double', `char', etc.). As the course progressed, we got to know more complicated things, such as the concept of namespace (`using namespace std`), loop structures and writing various functions. In addition to this, we familiarized ourselves with data structures offered by the standard library (`std`), such as `std::string`, `std::vector`, `std::set`, and `std::map`. Around the middle of the course, we started getting to know header files and through that also object-oriented programming. We also learned how to process data from text files using `fstream', and how to make simple user interfaces with Qt.

### About the practical implementation

The assignments were handed out on Tampere University's Plussa learning platform and were automatically tested there as well. We used ``git'' as a method of submission and a university-hosted GitLab server as a remote. The programming itself took place in Qt Creator, which also comes with ``Qt'' itself.

### What I learned

I found the course really challenging at times, because there were a lot of assignments to submit every week. I also actively travelled to Tampere to participate in weekly workshops, where problem solutions were reviewed under the teacher's guidance. I learned quite a lot of different things from C++ and can already write functions that return different kinds of values. I leaned to handle basic level data structures as well. I now know how to use Qt Creator and the basics of ``Qt''.
